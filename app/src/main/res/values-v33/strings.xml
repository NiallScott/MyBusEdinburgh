Before you can add a proximity alert, you need to grant the app access to accurate locations and the ability to post notifications.</string>
    <string name="addproxalertdialog_error_permission_denied">This feature works by monitoring your location and then showing you a notification when you are near your selected stop. Because of insufficient permission access, this feature is unable to function. This can be fixed by changing the permission access for this app inside system settings.</string>
