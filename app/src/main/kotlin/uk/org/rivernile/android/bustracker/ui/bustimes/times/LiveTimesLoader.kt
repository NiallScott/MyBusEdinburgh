/**
 * This class loads [Flow]s of live time data. It uses triggers and data from other sources to load
 * the live times.
 *
 * - A stop code is required to load live times. If the stop code is `null`, then an error will be
 *   emitted. The stop code is updatable - if it is updated, the data will be reloaded.
 * - We need to know how many departures per service to load. This is obtained from preferences. We
 *   wait until we have this value before we load the data. If this value is updated, a reload of
 *   the data will occur.
 * - A refresh trigger is supported. When a new item appears in the refresh trigger [Flow], the data
 *   will be reloaded with the current stop code and number of departures data.
 *
 * @param liveTimesRetriever This is used to retrieve live times.
 * @param preferenceRepository Used to obtain preferences which are required to load the data.
