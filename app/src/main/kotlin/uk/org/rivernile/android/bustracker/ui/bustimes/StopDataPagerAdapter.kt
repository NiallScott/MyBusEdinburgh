     * When swiping to [StopDetailsFragment] and swiping back to [BusTimesFragment], the location
     * access symbol will perpetually stay in the status bar. This is because the details Fragment,
     * despite no longer being visible, is still requesting locations. Why?
     *
     * Because [FragmentStateAdapter] merely puts the details Fragment back to a
     * [Lifecycle.State.STARTED] state. In this state, LiveData instances in [StopDetailsFragment]
     * are still active, and up the chain this still causes locations to be collected. This is
     * consistent with normal Android practice, because a STARTED element normally means the item
     * is still visible.
     *
     * Except it's not in this case, because it's been scrolled off-screen. We don't want to be
     * collecting locations when the user can't see [StopDetailsFragment] as this will hammer the
     * battery.
     *
     * This is controlled under the hood by [FragmentStateAdapter] by controlling the maximum
     * lifecycle of a Fragment via the FragmentManager. When a Fragment is the primary item, its max
     * lifecycle is [Lifecycle.State.RESUMED], and when not the primary item but cached, it is
     * [Lifecycle.State.STARTED]. It's because of this that the details Fragment is still started
     * and its LiveDatas are still active.
     *
     * So instead, we register this callback and implement
     * [FragmentStateAdapter.FragmentTransactionCallback] so we know when the maximum lifecycle for
     * a Fragment is changing. In the case the Fragment is [StopDetailsFragment], AND its maximum
     * lifecycle is [Lifecycle.State.STARTED], we then perform another transaction to forcefully
     * place its max lifecycle down to [Lifecycle.State.CREATED]. This means the Fragment still
     * exists, but all of its LiveDatas will be inactive.
