# Security Policy

## Supported versions

As this is a mobile app and there can only be one version on the Play Store at any one time, only
the latest version of the app is supported. There will be no patches or fixes supplied for older
versions of the app.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report any suspected security vulnerabilities to riverniall at gmail dot com. If the report
is deemed to be a viable security issue, an attempt will be made as soon as is practically possible
to fix the issue and perform a new general release.

This is an open source project and the app is given away for free. There is no commercial interest
in this project, and no money is made from this project. As such, it is not possible to offer a
reward ("bug bounty") scheme.
